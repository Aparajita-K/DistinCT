Description: The DistinCT package provides tools for the abstraction of CT scan indications in 
    long-term lung cancer survivors by analyzing patients' electronic health records (EHR). 
    It includes functions for reading and preprocessing EHR data including CT scan reports, 
    extracting structured EHR and NLP features, and applying a fitted logistic regression model 
    to predict whether CT scans are performed for surveillance or other reasons. This package 
    is designed to assist healthcare professionals and researchers in understanding the 
    underlying reasons for CT scans in oncological care, thereby aiding in more informed 
    clinical decisions.
